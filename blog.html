    <strong class="border-b-2 border-red-600"> <br> var</strong>

    <p>
    Variables declared with var are function-scoped or globally-scoped, but not block-scoped. <br> If declared within a function, the variable is limited to that function's scope.
    If declared outside of any function, the variable is globally accessible throughout the entire script. <br> Variables declared with var are subject to "hoisting," meaning they are moved to the top of their scope during the compilation phase.
    Because of hoisting, <br> you can access and use a var variable before it's actually declared in the code.
    </p>
    <strong class="border-b-2 border-red-600">let</strong>
    
    <p>
    Variables declared with let are block-scoped, meaning their scope is limited to the block (enclosed by curly braces) in which they are defined. <br> let variables are not hoisted to the top of their scope like var variables.
    They can be updated or reassigned within their scope.
    <p>
    <strong class="border-b-2 border-red-600">const</strong>

    <p>
    Variables declared with const are block-scoped and also have a constant value, meaning they cannot be reassigned after their initial value assignment. <br> const variables must be assigned a value when declared, and this value cannot be changed. Like let, const variables are not hoisted to the top of their scope.

    Tell us the use cases of <span class="text-red-600">null</span> and
    <span class="text-red-600">undefined</span>
  </h3>
  <div class="mx-auto bg-white-900 rounded-lg p-5">
    <strong class="border-b-2  border-red-600">Answers:</strong>
    <strong class="border-b-2 border-red-600"> <br> null</strong>
    <p>It is the intentional absence of the value. It is one of the primitive values of JavaScript.</p>

    <strong class="border-b-2 border-red-600">undefined</strong>
    <p>It means the value does not exist in the compiler. It is the global object.</p>

    What do you mean by
    <span class="text-red-600">REST</span> API?
  </h3>
  <div class="mx-auto bg-white-900 rounded-lg p-5">

    <strong class="border-b-2 border-red-600"> <br> REST API</strong>
    <p>
      A REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming
      Interface) is a standardized way for software applications to
      communicate over the internet. <br> It uses HTTP methods (like GET, POST,
      PUT, and DELETE) to access and manipulate resources (such as data) on
      a server. <br> REST APIs are known for their simplicity, scalability, and
      use of URLs to identify resources. <br> They are widely used for building
      web services and enabling interactions between different software
      systems.
